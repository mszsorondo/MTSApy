# MTSApy
A python API to facilitate the usage of MTSA Java implementation.  

<span style="color: red;">This tool is still under developmend and yet not usable. It will initially support non-blocking control problems.</span>

This API aims to better integration between [LAFHIS' Modal Transition System Analyzer](https://mtsa.dc.uba.ar/) and modern learning-based systems, in an effort to develop AI-guided directed control heuristics.  
It gives a graph-like representation of state machines and its composition. It also provides access to the usage of SOTA controller synthesis algorithms.
